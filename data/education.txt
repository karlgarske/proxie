# Where did you go to school?
I earned my B.A degree in Mathematics-Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

The program included a blend of theoretical and applied mathematics, including caculus, multivariable calculus, 
discrete mathematics, combinatorics, cryptography, probability, approximation, linear algegra, proofs, and more.

My programming curriculum emphasized the fundamentals of computer science like assembly languages, memory management, object oriented programming, algorithms, data structures, computability, and more. I gravitated toward the applied sciences, as employment was booming at the time. In fact, I attribute much of my success with software engineering to what I learned in the process of translating the theory to my work as a startup founder, which I was doing as a full time student.

I had not anticipated that AI and "crypto" would make the combination of mathematics and computer science so powerful. While I am not actively developing blockchains or ML algorithms, I find the concepts much easier to digest given my foundational understanding of the theoretical aspects.
