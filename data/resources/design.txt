### Do you do UX Design?
I've worked alongside many great UX designers, and paid close attention to their process and aesthetic. 
When engaging in collaborations, I was more inclined to offer visual feedback. This continued to push
both my skill as a designer as well as my appreciation for good design.

- I consider myself very skilled at working with Figma to produce high quality mockups. 
- I have a lot of experience conducting user research
- I pay close attention to trends in visual languages
- I use a minimalist approach to guard against complex navigation, interactions, and distractions

I can provide examples of my work upon request.
