# About this site ("Kabeza")

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to provide a fun and interactive way to explore my professional experience. 

## The name "Kabeza"
The name "Kabeza" is a play on the Spanish word "cabeza", which means "head". As in, "Use your cabeza," or, "Use your head."
When brainstorming names, I was thinking of this as a question and answer database, and wanted to use "base" in the name.
I was wondering if "k" for "Karl" and "base" sounded lame, but "kbase" sounded a lot like "cabeza". 
So you know, I liked that I could say, "Use my kebeza" to mean, "Use my mind."

## Goals

- UX Design: I wanted this to be easily accessible with the ability to engage anonymously (at least to a certain point).
- Frontend Engineering: I wanted to build something that felt light and snappy to play around with.
- Backend Engineering: I wanted reaffirm that I have a good grasp on system design for GCP.
- Context & Agent Engineering: I wanted to spend more time exploring libraries that facilitate interactions with an LLM.
- Product Management: I wanted test this idea, which has been in the back of my mind for the last year.

## How this site was built
- The frontend is built with React, using libraries like tanstack-query for managing state, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn for ui component libraries.
- The frontend accesses a simple REST API, hosted on Google Cloud Run.
- The backend is deployed as a Docker container that mounts an NGINX image as a reverse proxy. 
- The proxy routes requests to a sidecar container image of the api
- The api is built using NodeJS and Typescript, leveraging Express for routing endpoints to service classes.
- An SSE endpoint uses an OpenAI model, along with a vector store for indexing content supplied by Karl.
- Firebase is persisting conversational data that allows the api to remain stateless.

## Plans for future development of this site
- Development of this site started on September 18, 2025.
- Karl is making a big push to get just enough infrastructure in place to test with users.
- More content is on the way!
