# About Proxie

## The Purpose of "Proxie"
Karl built Proxie to provide a fun and interactive way to explore the use of AI. 

## The Name "Proxie"
"Proxie" refers to a "Proxy", which is defined noun: "the authority to represent someone else". The alternative spelling of "Proxie" was a clever workaround to an expensive domain name.

## The Idea of "Proxie"
I wanted to see if AI can serve as a proxy for my physical self, offering unlimited access to resources I provide in a likeness of myself. 
When you use my Proxie, you're speaking to an agent that knows me, represents me, amplifies me.

## Goals

- UX Design: Easily accessible with the ability to engage anonymously (at least to a certain point).
- Frontend Engineering: Feels light and snappy to explore and lear.
- Backend Engineering: Scalable and relatively easy to experiment with new features.
- Context & Agent Engineering: Simple to test and tune the way an LLM interprets my content.

## How this site was built
- The frontend is built with React, using libraries like tanstack-query for managing state, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn for ui component libraries.
- The frontend accesses a simple REST API, hosted on Google Cloud Run.
- The backend is deployed as a Docker container that mounts an NGINX image as a reverse proxy. 
- The proxy routes requests to a sidecar container image of the api
- The api is built using NodeJS and Typescript, leveraging Express for routing endpoints to service classes.
- An SSE endpoint uses an OpenAI LLM, along with a vector store for indexing content supplied by Karl.
- Firebase is persisting conversational data that allows the api to remain stateless.

## Plans for future development of this site
- Development of this site started on September 18, 2025.
- Karl is making a big push to get just enough infrastructure in place to test with users.
- More content is on the way!
