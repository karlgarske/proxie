# About this site ("Proxie")

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to provide a fun and interactive way to explore my professional experience. 

## The name "Proxie"
"Proxie" was a cheaper way of spelling "Proxy" when it comes to registering domain names. The idea is that AI can serve as a proxy for my physical self, offering unlimited access to resources I'm providing as an individual. When you use my Proxie, you're speaking to an agent that knows me, represents me, amplifies me.

## Goals

- UX Design: I wanted this to be easily accessible with the ability to engage anonymously (at least to a certain point).
- Frontend Engineering: I wanted to build something that felt light and snappy to play around with.
- Backend Engineering: I wanted reaffirm that I have a good grasp on system design for GCP.
- Context & Agent Engineering: I wanted to spend more time exploring libraries that facilitate interactions with an LLM.
- Product Management: I wanted test this idea, which has been in the back of my mind for the last year.

## How this site was built
- The frontend is built with React, using libraries like tanstack-query for managing state, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn for ui component libraries.
- The frontend accesses a simple REST API, hosted on Google Cloud Run.
- The backend is deployed as a Docker container that mounts an NGINX image as a reverse proxy. 
- The proxy routes requests to a sidecar container image of the api
- The api is built using NodeJS and Typescript, leveraging Express for routing endpoints to service classes.
- An SSE endpoint uses an OpenAI model, along with a vector store for indexing content supplied by Karl.
- Firebase is persisting conversational data that allows the api to remain stateless.

## Plans for future development of this site
- Development of this site started on September 18, 2025.
- Karl is making a big push to get just enough infrastructure in place to test with users.
- More content is on the way!
